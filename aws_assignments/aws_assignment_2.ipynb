        "- It's easy to host dynamic websites as it allows to run of web and application servers in the cloud\n",
        "- Easy to store all your files so that you can access them from anywhere and anytime\n",
        "- It allows you to use managed databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL, PostgreSQL to store data\n",
        "- With the use of the content delivery network, it delivers static and dynamic files faster\n",
        "- With AWS, it's simple to send bulk email to your clients or customers effectively\n",
